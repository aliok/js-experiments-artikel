== The App  ==

This application is just an example application for the "future" blog post about mobile applications
with Html5, JQueryMobile, WebSqlDatabase, PhoneGap and other mobile technologies.

This repository will have different branches where all of them will represent a different step through
the process of a cool Html5 mobile application for different platforms.

The application is a simple German "artikel" learning application.
